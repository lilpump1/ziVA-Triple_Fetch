# Sandbox escape

Like mentioned, AppleAVEDriver direct access requires sandbox escape (either mediaserverd sandbox context or no sandbox at all). Fortunately, Sandbox escape exploits have been released by P0, which means this can be used to completely compromise a kernel, and a step towards a full jailbreak.

# Is it a Jailbreak?

This is a crucial part in a Jailbreak chain, but this never aimed to become a Jailbreak.

# Is this going to be a jailbreak?

Maybe, if someone wants to work on that

# ziVA3
A Xcode built version of Adam Donenfeld's ziVA exploit (With offsets)
# What will this do?
I haven't even been able to get this to run properly on my phone, so I don't know yet. It compiles well, so if anyone wants to take a look at it, go ahead.
# Why did you put this here?
I haven't seen anyone put out a "user friendly" version of the PoC on /r/jailbreak, most likely because of the overall amount of novices on that sub. I'm going to try and help them out by giving them a place to start.
